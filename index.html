            <h1>"In the near future, I hope to become a Developer."</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">My dream is to become a successful web developer. Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. I will also do this kind of work in the near future.</p>
