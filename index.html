                <h1>"In the near future, I hope to become a Developer."</h1>
                <p>My dream is to become a successful web developer. Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. I will also do this kind of work in the near future.</p>

                <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
                <p>One of the main motivations for web developers is their passion for learning new things and keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. Web development is constantly evolving and changing, and web developers need to adapt and update their skills and knowledge accordingly.
